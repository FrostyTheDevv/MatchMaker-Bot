# Matchmaker Bot

A Discord bot for random 1-on-1 matchmaking with moderated profiles and ticket-based private chat threads. Users create profiles, join the matchmaking queue, and are paired into private threads with Skip, Report, and End controls. Profiles are stored in SQLite and must be approved by moderators before use.

## üî• Features

- **Profile System**: Multi-step slash command (`/profile`) to create name, age, gender, and bio. Pending moderator approval.
