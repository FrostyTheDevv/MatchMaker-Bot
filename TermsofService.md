# Matchmaker Bot Terms of Service

_Last updated: 2025-05-17

By using the Matchmaker Bot (“the Bot”) in this Discord server, you agree to the following terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

Use of the Bot’s commands (`/profile`, `/match`, `/viewprofile`, button interactions, etc.) constitutes acceptance of these Terms of Service (“ToS”).

---

## 2. Eligibility

- You must be at least **18+ years old** to interact with the Bot (per Discord’s Terms).  
- You must meet your local age of digital consent for data processing (if same or older then server limit).  
- By providing your age in `/profile`, you confirm you meet these requirements.

---

## 3. User Conduct

When using the Bot, you must not:
- Provide false, inaccurate, or misleading information in your profile.  
- Harass, threaten, or abuse other users in match threads.  
- Post illicit, hateful, or copyrighted content.  
- Exploit or reverse-engineer the Bot’s code or database.

Server rules apply at all times; violating server rules may result in removal from matchmaking or server suspension.

## 4. Moderation & Enforcement

- **Reports**: Clicking “Report” pings the Moderator role. Moderators may review the thread and take action.  
- **Skip**: If you skip, the session ends and you’re re-queued.  
- **End**: Ends the session; thread is archived for moderator review.  
- **Unapproved Profiles**: You cannot use `/match` or `/viewprofile` until a moderator approves your `/profile` submission.

## 5. Intellectual Property

- The Bot’s source code is licensed under the MIT License (see `LICENSE.md`).  
- All trademarks, logos, etc., remain the property of their respective owners.  
- Your profile text remains yours; by submitting it, you grant the Bot a license to display it to matched users and moderators.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE BOT IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. The developers disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Use at your own risk.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPERS OR SERVER ADMINISTRATORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE BOT.

## 8. Changes to Terms

We may update these ToS as the Bot evolves. We’ll post the date of last revision here. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.
